# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

When first starting my guide I wanted to make sure I understood core concepts and displayed them in a campact and concise way so they could later be easily deciphered in referrence. I built this project, step by step, in order to understand the process of the languages taught throughout the Prework. It solves the problem of having a referrence point to go back to later in urder to understand the fundamentals of this program. I learned the languages taught as best I could and feel like I have some basic knowledge pertaining to them.
